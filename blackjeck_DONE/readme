in line 721 there is the function betting()
that checks how much the user want to bet.


int betting() //Asks user amount to bet
{
 printf("\n\nEnter Bet: $");
 scanf("%d", &bet);
 
 if (bet > cash) //If player tries to bet more money than player has
 {
        printf("\nYou cannot bet more money than you have.");
        printf("\nEnter Bet: ");
        scanf("%d", &bet);
        return bet;
 }
 else return bet;
} // End Function
 


since the program only checks once if the user got over the buget that he have.
I was able to manipulaite it to let me enter any amount i want in the second time (betting for 1M-2B int limit)

I started to play (never played blackjack before so just did rendomaize things at start)
Then i saw this function
that seid as long as i wait the deale 
void stay() //Function for when user selects 'Stay'
{
     dealer(); //If stay selected, dealer continues going
     if(dealer_total>=17)
     {
      if(player_total>=dealer_total) //If player's total is more than dealer's total, win
      {
         printf("\nUnbelievable! You Win!\n");
         won = won+1;
         cash = cash+bet;
         printf("\nYou have %d Wins and %d Losses. Awesome!\n", won, loss);
         dealer_total=0;
         askover();
      }
      if(player_total<dealer_total) //If player's total is less than dealer's total, loss
      {
         printf("\nDealer Has the Better Hand. You Lose.\n");
         loss = loss+1;
         cash = cash - bet;
         printf("\nYou have %d Wins and %d Losses. Awesome!\n", won, loss);
         dealer_total=0;
         askover();
      }
      if(dealer_total>21) //If dealer's total is more than 21, win
      {
         printf("\nUnbelievable! You Win!\n");
         won = won+1;
         cash = cash+bet;
         printf("\nYou have %d Wins and %d Losses. Awesome!\n", won, loss);
         dealer_total=0;
         askover();
      }
     }
     else
     {
         stay();
     }
      
}


and all i nedd to do is to build a simple script that would run in a loop until the dealer gets over 21 

the script is in exploit.py
